Space Tears and Constalations 
Created: April 1st, 2023. 

This sketch displays red, yellow, and some blue tear drops in space. The selection for tears as the main shape of the sketch was purely for creative reasons. There is no deeper meaning, just space tears. This sketch includes 50 randomly generated blue lines when the user clicks on the canvas. These blue lines represent randomly generated constallations within the space theme of the sketch. 

Overall, my goal was to create a creative, abstract, and simple version of our solar system. 

Enjoy.
